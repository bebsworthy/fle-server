  - **Result**: Functional and integrated

### Broken/Missing Requirements ‚ùå

- [ ] Requirement 8.4: Supports .env file for local development
  - Expected: .env file should be automatically loaded
  - **Testing Result**: Created .env file but values not loaded
  - **Error/Issue**: No automatic .env file loading implemented
  - **User Impact**: Developers must set environment variables manually instead of using .env file

### Partial Implementation ‚ö†Ô∏è
None - All other requirements are fully implemented.

## Specification Deviations

### Critical Deviations üî¥
None - No critical deviations found.

### Minor Deviations üü°

1. **Deviation**: .env file not automatically loaded
   - **Spec Reference**: Requirement 8.4 - "The server SHALL support a .env file for local development"
   - **Implementation**: .env.example provided but no automatic loading
   - **Recommendation**: Add godotenv package or similar to load .env files automatically

## Action Items for Developer

### Must Fix (Blocking)
None - All critical requirements are met.

### Should Fix (Non-blocking)
1. Implement automatic .env file loading to fully satisfy requirement 8.4
   - Consider using godotenv package
   - Load .env file in main.go before config.Load()
   - Only load if file exists (don't fail if missing)

### Consider for Future
1. Add more comprehensive logging setup in main.go
2. Consider adding version information to build
3. Add docker-compose for local development environment

## Approval Status
- [ ] Approved - Feature is fully functional and integrated
- [x] Conditionally Approved - Works but needs minor fixes
- [ ] Requires Revision - Feature is broken/unusable/not integrated

**Key Question: Can a user successfully use this feature right now?**
YES - The foundation is fully functional. The missing .env file support is a convenience feature that doesn't block development.

## Next Steps
1. Implement .env file loading support (non-blocking)
2. Proceed with Track B (HTTP Server and Logging) as foundation is solid
3. Consider adding the suggested improvements in future iterations

## Detailed Findings

### go.mod
- Module properly initialized as `github.com/fle/server`
- Go version 1.24.5 specified (appears to be a typo - should be 1.21.5 or similar)
- No dependencies yet (expected for foundation)

### Makefile
- Excellent comprehensive Makefile with 30+ targets
- Well-organized with sections for Development, Building, Testing, Code Quality, Security
- Color-coded output for better developer experience
- Includes advanced targets like cross-platform builds, coverage reports, benchmarks
- Future-ready with placeholders for Docker and database operations

### internal/config/config.go
- Well-structured configuration management
- Comprehensive validation with detailed error messages
- Helper methods for environment detection (IsDevelopment, IsProduction, IsTest)
- Proper separation of concerns with loading and validation
- Good default values for all settings
- Missing: Automatic .env file loading

### .env.example
- Comprehensive example file with all configuration options
- Well-documented with explanations for each setting
- Includes both development and production examples
- Good practice for onboarding new developers

### cmd/server/main.go
- Clean entry point with proper error handling
- Currently just loads and logs configuration (expected for foundation phase)
- Ready for server implementation in next phases
- Missing: .env file loading before config.Load()

Overall, Track A provides a solid foundation for the FLE server with proper Go project structure, comprehensive build tooling, and robust configuration management. The only missing piece is automatic .env file loading, which is a minor convenience feature that can be added without blocking further development.
