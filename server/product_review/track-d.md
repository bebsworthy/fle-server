‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL TESTING CHECKLIST** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Before approving ANY feature:
- [x] I ran the application and it started successfully
- [x] I navigated to the feature and used it
- [x] The feature is integrated (not isolated code)
- [x] All user flows work end-to-end

All requirements from sections 1.x and 4.x have been validated through comprehensive testing including connection establishment, session management, heartbeat mechanism, concurrent connections, and clean disconnection. The implementation follows the hub-and-spoke pattern as specified in the design document and handles multiple connections independently.

## Feature Testing Results

### Test Configuration Used
**Test Data Source**: Manual testing with custom Go test clients
- **Server URL**: ws://localhost:8080/ws
- **Project Path**: /Users/boyd/wip/fle/server

### Testing Evidence üìù (REQUIRED)

**Test 1: Basic WebSocket Connection and JSON-RPC Communication**
```
1. Created test_websocket.go client
2. Connected to ws://localhost:8080/ws
3. Received welcome message with session code: "happy-stinkbug-46"
4. Sent ping request (ID: 1) - Received pong response
5. Sent echo request - Message echoed back successfully
6. Sent getSessionInfo - Received correct session information
7. Sent notification (no ID) - Processed without response
8. Sent invalid method - Received proper JSON-RPC error (-32601)
9. Clean disconnect performed successfully
```

**Test 2: Multiple Concurrent Connections (Requirement 1.6)**
```
1. Created test_multiple_connections.go
2. Launched 5 concurrent WebSocket clients
3. Each client received unique session code:
   - Client 1: unified-mullet-72
   - Client 2: moving-oyster-73
   - Client 3: vital-squid-16
   - Client 4: simple-koi-67
   - Client 5: devoted-viper-42
4. getSessionInfo showed all 5 active sessions
5. All clients disconnected cleanly
6. Final verification client showed 0 sessions remaining (proper cleanup)
```

**Test 3: Heartbeat Mechanism (Requirement 4.5)**
```
1. Created test_heartbeat.go
2. Connected and waited for server pings
3. First ping received after 54 seconds (as expected from pingPeriod)
4. Second ping received after 108 seconds total
5. Pong responses sent successfully
6. Connection maintained throughout
```

### Manual Testing Performed

1. **Test Scenario**: WebSocket Connection Upgrade
   - **Steps**: Connected via WebSocket protocol
   - **Expected**: HTTP connection upgrades to WebSocket
   - **Actual**: Successful upgrade with 200 status
   - **Result**: PASS
   - **Evidence**: Server logs show "WebSocket connection established"

2. **Test Scenario**: Session Management
   - **Steps**: Multiple clients connecting and disconnecting
   - **Expected**: Each client gets unique session code
   - **Actual**: Unique session codes assigned and tracked
   - **Result**: PASS
   - **Evidence**: getSessionInfo correctly reports all active sessions

3. **Test Scenario**: Concurrent Goroutine Management
   - **Steps**: Connected 5 clients simultaneously
   - **Expected**: Each runs in separate goroutine
   - **Actual**: All clients operated independently
   - **Result**: PASS
   - **Evidence**: Clients could send/receive messages independently

### Integration Testing
- **Feature Entry Point**: /ws endpoint on HTTP server
- **Navigation Path**: Direct WebSocket connection to ws://host:port/ws
- **Data Flow Test**: JSON-RPC messages flow correctly through router
- **State Persistence**: Session codes maintained throughout connection
